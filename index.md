# hello stranger

i try to document different topics here, ranging from technical notes to personal reflections and learnings

stuff I'm focusing on right now:
- performing and contributing meaningfully to my job at OKX. Working as a Software Engineer/Security Researcher, reviewing smart contracts and working on security tools
- embracing the “AI” age, [[keeping-up-with-ai |pondering about how to stay relevant in this age]] 
- [[learning-again|living life]] outside of blockchain and tech

i also enjoy bouldering and basketball
