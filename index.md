# About Me

Hey, I'm Wu Chuan. Currently working as a Software Engineer at OKX.

I try to document different topics here, ranging from technical notes to personal reflections and learnings

Things I'm working on at the moment:
- Blockchain Security (Smart Contracts & Security Tools)
- Distributed Systems

More fun things I'm (mildly) addicted to:
- Climbing (Bouldering)
- Basketball
