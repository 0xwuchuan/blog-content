# About Me

Hey, I'm Wu Chuan.

I try to document different topics here, ranging from technical notes to personal reflections and learnings. I don't write much so everything will be pretty messy and shitty to read but hopefully the more I write the better it gets. 

Stuff I'm focusing on right now:
- Performing and contributing meaningfully to my job at OKX. Working as a Software Engineer/Security Researcher, reviewing smart contracts and working on security tools
- Embracing the “AI” age, [[keeping-up-with-ai |pondering about how to stay relevant in this age]] 
- [[learning-again|Living life]] outside of blockchain and tech

I also enjoy bouldering and basketball
