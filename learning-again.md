Recently I find myself wanting to learn new things that I did not manage to when I was young. 

One of these things is Swimming! More specifically, doing freestyle. I learned swimming when I was young but somehow or another stopped taking lessons before fully learning how to swim freestyle.

It is humbling to try to get better at something when you are starting at zero (as with everything in life). But it feels even worse when it’s something most people already learned when they were young. 

I have always avoided trying new things simply because starting from zero is extremely daunting (and i hate sucking). But I guess it is a goal of mine to learning everything that I wanted to. Swimming freestyle is just the start!

Things I want to eventually get to learning and getting better at:
- Playing a musical instrument - Guitar (i learned piano when i was young but i hated it cause i sucked)
- Drawing (im terrible)
- Editing Videos

Getting over the initial barrier of feeling like shit at the start will be tough. But hopefully I get to look back at the end and see how far I’ve come :)
